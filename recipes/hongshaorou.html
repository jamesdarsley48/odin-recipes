        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A great Chinese pork dish that I would eat every day of my whole life, if that was possible. Apparently Chairman Mao liked it.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5lb pork belly, with the skin attached</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons rock sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup Shaoxing wine</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon <strong>dark</strong> soy sauce</li>
            <li>2-3 cups water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut your pork belly into 3/4-inch thick pieces. Add them to a medium pot and cover with water. Bring the water to a boil, and boil for about 1 minute, or just until the pork turns opaque. This removes impurities and starts the cooking process. Take the pork out of the pot, rinse, and set it aside. Discard the water and clean out your pot.</li>
            <li>Over low heat, add the oil and sugar to your wok or pot. Melt the sugar, and add the pork. Raise the heat to medium, and cook until the pork is lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low, and add the wine. Cook for 2 minutes, then add the soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and water.</li>
            <li>Cover and simmer over medium heat for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, until pork is fork tender. Every 5-10 minutes, stir to prevent burning and add more water if it gets too dry.</li>
            <li>Once the pork is fork tender, if there is still a lot of visible liquid, uncover the wok, turn up the heat, and stir continuously until the sauce has reduced to a glistening coating.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The water should mostly cover the pork belly in the pot in order to braise it properly. If using a thick-bottomed pot, you may need lessâ€”say 2 cups, as it will evaporate slower. That said, you can also just cook it longer to reduce the sauce.</li>
        </ul>
